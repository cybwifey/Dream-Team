Using data science and artificial intelligence to develop data-driven solutions that support aging populations and improve chronic disease management




## Getting started + Git Workflow Instructions
Here’s how we’ll work together using Git and GitHub. Don’t worry if you’re new, simply just follow these steps each time you work on the project!


**1. Clone the repo** (first time only):
This copies the code from GitHub to your own computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai_health_inquiry.git
cd ai_health_inquiry



**2. Pull the latest changes** (Everytime you start working!):
This grabs the latest changes from the GitHub repo so you're not working on old code.
Do this every time you start a new session, even if you just worked on it yesterday.

git pull origin main



**3. Create new branch for your work**:
Branches are like “drafts” — your changes stay separate until you’re ready to share.
Use names like feature/signup-page or bugfix/typo-readme.

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name



**4. Make changes, then commit** (Always include a short description of your work/changes):
Staging (git add): marks what changes you want to save.
Committing (git commit): saves a snapshot with a message describing your work.


git add .
git commit -m "feat: short description of your work"



**5. Push your branch to github**:
This sends your branch up to GitHub so others can see it and review it.

git push origin feature/your-feature-name



**6. Open a pull request(PR)**:
Now go to the GitHub website:
  1. Click “Pull Requests” → “New Pull Request”
  2. Choose your branch (on the right) and compare it to main
  3. Add a title and short description
  4. Click Create Pull Request
  5. We'll review each other's PRs and merge them into main only after everything works!


##  Team Git Workflow Rules
  1. Never push directly to main!!!
  2. Always use a separate branch (feature/*, bugfix/*, or docs/*)
  3. Always pull before starting your work
  4. Review others’ pull requests before merging
  5. Keep commits small and focused
